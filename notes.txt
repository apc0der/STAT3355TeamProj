CLEANING STUFF
# Diamond Princess and Grand Princess cases in us.csv - Cruise ship COVID hospital
# where death rate is 0 --> clean
# keep it to the 50 states (don't include territories)

# DATA WE NEED TO COLLECT
# cases and deaths by state
# coastal subset vs noncoastal subset 
# population density map vs cases map
# graph time vs case count
# get timeline of COVID related events
# death rate/proportion
# GDP per capita vs covid cases
# each day daily cases in us/ daily cases in the world
# which countries shut down borders data
# testing rate vs mortality rate
